# Project 1: RPG "shop"

This is a basic introductory look at cpp. 

I have no experience with cpp, so this is the first of a series of project that I hope will expose me to many of the basics in the language.

For this project, the focus is to learn how things work through a text based shop.

It is by no means exhaustive, and much of the expected functionality is not present, but I hope to establish a starting point in my endeavour to learn cpp.

I have created music and sound effects for the project as well, so learning how to use SFML will be a necessary hurdle I must face.

Running the project is hassle free, simply download the contents of the release folder into the same directory.

The directory should contain main.exe, 24.wav, and fx.wav.
