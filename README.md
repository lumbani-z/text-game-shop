# Built with the CMake SFML Project Template

This is a basic introductory look at cpp. The focus is on exposure to basic ideas through a text based shop.
It is by no means exhaustive, but I hope to learn how to use the basics in cpp and SFML's audio functions.
Running the project is hassle free, simply download the transferrable folder and place main.exe in the same directory as 24.wav and fx.wav.
