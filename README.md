# Project 1: RPG shop

This is an introductory look at cpp. 

This is the first of a series of projects that will expose me to the basics in the language.

For this project, the focus is to see how things work in cpp through a text based shop.

I hope this will establish a starting point in my endeavour to learn cpp.

I have created music and sound effects for the project as well. Learning how to use SFML will be a necessary.

Running the project is easy. Simply download the contents of the transferrable folder into one directory.

The directory should contain main.exe, 24.wav, and fx.wav.
